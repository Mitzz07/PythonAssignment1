    "1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "Ans: def statement is used to create a normal function. where as lamba expressions are used to create Anonymous functions. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function.\n",
    "Lambda's body is a single expression and not a block of statements like def statement. The lambda expression's body is similar to what we'd put in a def body's return statement. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def statement."

    "Ans:\n",
    "Function annotations are arbitrary python expressions that are associated with various part of functions. These expressions are evaluated at compile time and have no life in python's runtime environment. Python does not attach any meaning to these annotations\n",
    "To do function annotations, you annotate the arguments and the return value. The syntax for arguments is the argument's name, colon ( : ), space, and then whatever the annotation is. And then the syntax for return types is that space, greater than symbol arrow ( -> ), and then the annotation\n",
